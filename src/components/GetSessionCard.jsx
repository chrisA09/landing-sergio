          It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building
          experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of
          human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it
          underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another,
          and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've
          ever known.
